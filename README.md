## Libbox

Libbox is a library management system implemented in java.

Libbox has a micro-kernel style architecture and everything is designed in a way to be loosely coupled, therefore modules can be added/removed/modified with ease.


The reason I wrote this is that I came up with an idea and I had thousands of reasons why it sucks BUT I had a lot of reasons why it's so cool. So I started writing code and although I knew that I was doing crazy things, I did not stop. I don't regret it :-/
